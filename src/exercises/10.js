// control props

import React from 'react'
import {Switch} from '../switch'

// Here we're going to simplify our component slightly so you
// can learn the control props pattern in isolation from everything else.
// Next you'll put the pieces together.

class Toggle extends React.Component {
  state = {on: false}
  // üê® let's add a function that can determine whether
  // the on prop is controlled. Call it `isControlled`.
  // It can accept a string called `prop` and should return
  // true if that prop is controlled
  // üí∞ this.props[prop] !== undefined
  //
  // üê® Now let's add a function that can return the state
  // whether it's coming from this.state or this.props
  // Call it `getState` and have it return on from
  // state if it's not controlled or props if it is.
  toggle = () => {
    // üê® if the toggle is controlled, then we shouldn't
    // be updating state. Instead we should just call
    // `this.props.onToggle` with what the state should be
    this.setState(
      ({on}) => ({on: !on}),
      () => {
        this.props.onToggle(this.state.on)
      },
    )
  }
  render() {
    // üê® rather than getting state from this.state,
    // let's use our `getState` method.
    const {on} = this.state
    return <Switch on={on} onClick={this.toggle} />
  }
}

// These extra credit ideas are to expand this solution to elegantly handle
// more state properties than just a single `on` state.
// üíØ Make the `getState` function generic enough to support all state in
// `this.state` even if we add any number of properties to state.
// üíØ Add support for an `onStateChange` prop which is called whenever any
// state changes. It should be called with `changes` and `state`
// üíØ Add support for a `type` property in the `changes` you pass to
// `onStateChange` so consumers can differentiate different state changes.

// Don't make changes to the Usage component. It's here to show you how your
// component is intended to be used and is used in the tests.
// You can make all the tests pass by updating the Toggle component.
